## Purpose
This simple app was created to demonstrate how to create a Javascript app using TDD.
I used Jasmine because it is a popular test runner and I like the syntax.

## Jasmine unit tests
To run the test just open `index.html` in your browser and you will see which tests failed and which tests have passed.

## Installation & Requirements
To install this project just clone this repo.

Open the `app.html` in your browser and enter binary, hex, or decimal values. Click the convert button and the approriate conversion will be made.

## To-do
- Number validation e.g. decimals in binary field
- Prettify binary and hex numbers by adding spaces
- Fix home button placement
